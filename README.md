# VBA-challenge
Before You Begin
Create a new repository for this project called VBA-challenge. Do not add this assignment to an existing repository.
Inside the new repository that you just created, add any VBA files that you use for this assignment. These will be the main scripts to run for each analysis.
Instructions
Create a script that loops through all the stocks for each quarter and outputs the following information:
The ticker symbol
Quarterly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given quarter to the closing price at the end of that quarter.
The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given quarter to the closing price at the end of that quarter.
Other Considerations
Use the sheet alphabetical_testing.xlsx while developing your code. This dataset is smaller and will allow you to test faster. Your code should run on this file in just a few seconds.
Make sure that the script acts the same on every sheet. The joy of VBA is that it takes the tediousness out of repetitive tasks with the click of a button.
